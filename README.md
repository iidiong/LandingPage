## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## How_it_works

When there is no section(s) on the page, no navigation bar is displayed

When new sections are added to the page, the navigation bar is displayed, and navigation items for each sections are dynamically added to page

When navigation item on the nav bar is clicked, the page scrolls smoothly to the selected section

When user pan or mousewheel scroll through the sections, scroll postion is enforced to display one section at time.
